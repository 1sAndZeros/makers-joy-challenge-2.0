Please enjoy!.\nMy choice of song comes from a trio I have seen many times. Their sets always fill the room with such happiness and euphoria! Zoë Johnston features with stunning vocals on a song by Above and Beyond called “We’re All We Need”.\nMy inspirational quote comes from an incredible actor; the late, great and talented Robin Williams who dedicated his life to putting smile on other peoples face.\n“There is still a lot to learn and there is always great stuff out there. Even mistakes can be wonderful”\n ― Robin Williams\n@Pauline Lelièvre 🫵 You're up next!\nHave an awesome day! 👋"
